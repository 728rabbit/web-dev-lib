$('table.re-table').basictable({ breakpoint: 700 });

Options
Options are applicable to both the jQuery and Vanilla JS.

breakpoint
integer default: null

Define the breakpoint (viewport's width) when the table will engage in responsive mode. If the containerBreakpoint is null (which is the default) the value will be 568px.

containerBreakpoint
integer default: null

Define the breakpoint of the table's container when the table will engage in responsive mode.

contentWrap
boolean default: true

Wraps the original content within the cell in a span with class .bt-content, to help with CSS selection.

forceResponsive
boolean default: true

The library will always force the table into responsive mode once the breakpoint is met. If this is set to false the table will only change mode when the table itself is larger than its immediate parent's inner width.

noResize
boolean default: false

Disable Basic Table's JS resize. The table won't engage in responsive mode unless media query or another resize bind outside of Basic Table is defined.

tableWrap
boolean default: false

When the library is initialize create a div wrapper around the table with class .bt-wrapper. This wrapper will toggle an active class when the table mode changes.

showEmptyCells
boolean default: false

When true, empty cells will be shown.

header
boolean default: true

Set to false if table does not have a header row. Table will just be responsive with table body and optional footer.
